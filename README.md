# Hi there, I'm Laura! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD candidate under the supervision of [Dr. Ileana QuiÃ±ones](https://scholar.google.com.ar/citations?hl=es&user=dR4l9FcAAAAJ) and [Dr. Lucia Amoruso](https://scholar.google.com.ar/citations?user=2V_1BWcAAAAJ&hl=es) at the [Neurobiology of Language](https://twitter.com/NeuroLang_BCBL) research group at the [Basque center on Cognition, Brain and Language (BCBL)](https://www.bcbl.eu/es/investigacion/grupos-de-investigacion/neurobiologa-lenguaje) in [San SebastiÃ¡n - Donostia](https://www.sansebastianturismoa.eus/es/) (Spain). 
My thesis is oriented to 2 main goals:
- :hospital: Develop an intraoperative protocol for awake patient surgery technique in patients with right hemisphere brain tumors.
- :books: Investigate how a brain lesion in the right hemisphere affects the social cognition processes and the personality of the patient.

## About me

- :seedling: Iâ€™m currently learning the basis of social cognition processes and how to process MRI structural and functional images.
- :dancers: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on structural and functional MRI data analysis
