# Hi there, I'm Laura! 👋

I'm a PhD candidate at the [Neurobiology of Language](https://twitter.com/NeuroLang_BCBL) research group at the [Basque center on Cognition, Brain and Language (BCBL)](https://www.bcbl.eu/es/investigacion/grupos-de-investigacion/neurobiologa-lenguaje) in [San Sebastián - Donostia](https://www.sansebastianturismoa.eus/es/) (Spain). 
My thesis is oriented to 2 main goals:
- :hospital: Develop an intraoperative protocol for awake patient surgery technique in patients with right hemisphere brain tumors.
- :books: Investigate how a brain lesion in the right hemisphere affects the social cognition processes and the personality of the patient.
